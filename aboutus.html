        In developing a disadvantaged mining community Riverlea, in particular a township community through a holistic community development model that includes education, skills development, enterprise development, and healthcare.
The request for our efforts come from within the community, this prevents us from starting or running projects, without there being an actual need for such a project. The goal is to ensure sustainability of our project area and in particular our beneficiaries. The biggest complement we can receive is when our beneficiaries tell us that they don’t need our services anymore.
In treating our beneficiaries as equals. We value their insight, concerns and comments and try to implement these within our projects to ensure excellence of our projects. This however also comes with responsibilities. Our beneficiaries are partly responsible for their own development, we provide them with a platform in which they can thrive, then the responsibility is theirs to utilize the opportunities that are laid out for them.
That nothing is for “mahala” (for free). Ideal Charity Foundation is not a charity. We are not about giving a handout and don’t believe in giving people a fish but rather to teaching them how to fish in order to be independent and work for themselves. Our goal is for our township to become sustainable within 5-10 years.
In serving our community with love and passion. Our love for people has moved us from working for corporate companies to working for a non-profit organisation that is determined to uplift our community.
That NPOs must work more and more as social enterprises, where both the longevity of the organisation and its projects should be partially funded through income generated through the project.
